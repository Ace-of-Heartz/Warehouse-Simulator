### Description

A warehouse simulation software made using Unity's framework. Simulate the path-finding of robots to their respective goals and log all events, for example collision errors, that might occur during the simulation.   \
**List of features:**
- Simulate the path planning of robots using an arbitrary layout of the warehouse, number of robots and number of goals.
- Use predefined path-finding algorithms for running multiple simulations.
- Configure the number of steps, planning time and preparation for more precise control over the simulation.
- Record and save the events during the simulation.
- Playback a past simulation with more careful controls for analyzing the sequence of events.
